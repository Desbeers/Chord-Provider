If you add a **'musicpath'**  *directive* to your ChordPro file, Chord Provider can play the song if it knows where to look for it. The song has to be in the same folder as your ChordPro file.

For that reason, **Chord Provider** would like to know where to find your songs. Due to Apple's safety restrictions, you have to give permission to look for it.
