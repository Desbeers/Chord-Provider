**ChordPro** is an open standard text format and its has its own [official reference implementation](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/chordpro-directives/).

I contributed a lot to its [Open Source code](https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro).

While I hope you like **Chord Provider**, as *guitar player* or *macOS programmer*, it is just a hobby project for my own needs.

Go [there](https://chordpro.org) for the full **Chordpro** experience.
