			<h2>Chord Provider</h2>
			<p>This is a simple application to view and edit 'chordpro' files for your guitar songs.</p>

			<p>I made it because I wanted to have a 'chordpro' viewer/editor for Mac and iPad that is using iCloud for storage. Couldn't find it...</p>

			<p>It is released under the GPL3 licence and the project is on <a href="https://github.com/Desbeers/Chord-Provider">GitHub</a>.</p>

			<p><em>Oh, and I know this is not 'real' help, haha! I just don't want to have the &quot;help is not available' message in my application...</em></p>
