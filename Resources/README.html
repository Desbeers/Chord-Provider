            <h1>Chord Provider</h1>

            <h3>A <strong>ChordPro</strong> viewer, editor and PDF exporter for macOS</h3>

            <h2>What is ChordPro</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“A simple text format for the notation of lyrics with chords”.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>ChordPro</strong> is an open standard text format and its has its own <a href="https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/chordpro-directives/">official reference implementation</a>. I contributed a lot to its <a href="https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro">Open Source code</a>.</p>

            <p>While I hope you like <strong>Chord Provider</strong>, as <em>guitar player</em> or <em>macOS programmer</em>, it is just my hobby project. Go <a href="https://chordpro.org">there</a> for the full <strong>Chordpro</strong> experience.</p>

            <h2>It is not just drag and drop</h2>

            <p>Providing applications for the Mac platform is not as easy as it seems. For the users, its mostly just <em>drag and drop</em>. It is not that easy for developers. Apple has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/secf826eff27/web">lot of security</a> in place to make sure your <em>drag and drop</em> will be safe for you.</p>

            <p>It needs a lot of time, effort and yeh... money for developers to provide such application for the Mac.</p>

            <p><strong>Chord Provider</strong> is not a commercial product. It is an <em>Open Source</em> application made by me just for fun. You are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro">download the source</a>, compile it and enjoy!</p>

            <p>That is not realistic for must users, especially not on the Mac. I would love to provide you the expected experience but I can’t. I don't have an Apple Developers certificate to provide you this <em>ready to go</em> experience.</p>

            <h2>The Gatekeeper</h2>

            <p>Your download contains an <em>almost</em> ready to go <strong>Chord Provider</strong>; except that the application is only ad-hoc signed by me and not by an approved Apple Developer with a valid certificate. So, the security system on your Mac will give an error when you double-click the application. You have met the <em>Gatekeeper</em>. Depending of the version of macOS you have a different message and have to do different additional handlings to open <strong>Chord Provider</strong>.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Drag the application to your <code>Applications</code> folder.
                <li>Open the application by <em>double-clicking</em> on it.
            </ol>

            <p>A prompt saying '“<strong>Chord Provider</strong>“ Not Opened' will appear.</p>

            <p>The message will be more or less like this, depending on your macOS version:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Apple could not verify “Chord Provider.app“ is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><em>There is a small 'question mark' button at the right top of the dialog that opens the 'Mac User Guide' with more information.</em></p>

            <p>On macOS versions before 15 (Sequoia) it was common practice to <code>right-click</code> the application and choose <code>Open</code> from the menu. That trick will bypass the gatekeeper and let you open the application.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, that does not work anymore on Sequoia and you have to go trough <code>System Settings</code>:</p>

            <ol start="3">
                <li>Go to <code>System Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security</code>.</li>
                <li>Scroll down to find <strong>Chord Provider</strong>, and an option to &quot;Open Anyway&quot;.</li>
                <li>Choose &quot;Open Anyway&quot;.</li>
                <li>Authenticate as an administrator.</li>
                <li><strong>Chord Provider</strong> will now open.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Chord Provider</strong> is saved as an exception to your security settings and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it, just as you can with any other application.</p>

            <h2>Enjoy!</h2>

            <p>I hope you appreciate my best efforts.</p>

            <p>The Mac is a beautiful platform for its users.</p>
