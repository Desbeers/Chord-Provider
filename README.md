# Chord Provider

## A Cordpro file parser and editor in SwiftUI 2.0

There are many "chordpo" parsers in this world, however, none are *really* native in the Apple world. I mean, the macOS world, it is afterthought... Not for me.

This is for macOS and iOS. Written in SwiftUI 2.0, so Big Sur or iOS 14.

- System colors
- System fonts
- Dark screen support
