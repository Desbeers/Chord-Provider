# Chord Provider

## A Cordpro file parser and editor in SwiftUI 2.0

There are many "chordpo" parsers in this world, however, none are *realy* native to the Apple world.

This is for Mac and iOS. Written in Swift 2.0, so Big Sur or iOS 14.

### iCloud

It makes an iCloud folder; that's where your songs are stored.
