# Chord Provider

## A Cordpro file parser and editor in SwiftUI 2.0

There are many "chordpo" parsers in this world, however, none are *really* native in the Apple world. I mean, the macOS world, it is afterthought... Not for me.

![Chord Provider](https://github.com/Desbeers/Chord-Provider/blob/main/Shared/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/IconiOS-76@2x.png)

This is for macOS and iOS. Written in Swift 2.0, so Big Sur or iOS 14.

- System colors
- System fonts
- Dark screen support

### iCloud

It makes an iCloud folder; that's where your songs are stored.

### Thanks

Stole code (and ideadies) from:

### Bugs
	- The WebView doesn't align on first view in macOS
	- Slow parsing; very slow ;-)
